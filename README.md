# Article Base

`React.JS` `Reach Router` `Jest/Enzyme` `Bootstrap` 

This project reflects my interest in self-improvement, psychology and mental health. I wanted to know how machine learning was influencing the field and thought it would be great to have these kinds of articles conveniently organized in one place - so why not make my own [article base](http://kelley-sharp-article-base.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/)!

## About

Article Base is a collection of articles relating to psychiatry, therapy, data science, or machine learning taken from https://arxiv.org, a repository from Cornell University. It can be browsed by articles or by authors and contains publications from within the last 30 days. Go [here](http://kelley-sharp-article-base.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/) to browse the site.

## Highlights

* Discovering Reach Router and learning about its focus on accessibility.

* Writing unit tests with Jest.

* Using ES6 + create-react-app to brush up on my skills.

* Incorporating bootstrap and using react strap to build the nav bar.

* Finding some really interesting topics, including machine learning models, gesture recognition systems, and mental disorder prediction via analyzing speech.


## Challenges

There was no API end point to fetch a list of authors and their articles, so I had to map articles to authors manually and I needed to do a lot of data processing by hand.

If I revisit this project I would like to incorporate articles from other sources, making it more robust, and I would also like to add tests for the views - the components responsible for how the pages render.

## How to run this app locally

1. Clone this repository into a new directory.

2. In the project directory, run:

- ### `npm install` or `yarn install`
  This will install all the dependencies you need.

3. Now run:

- ### `npm start`
  This will run the app in development mode.<br>
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
